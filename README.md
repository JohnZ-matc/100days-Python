# 100 Days of Python

## Project Overview

the point of this project is to practice my Python skills everyday for 100 days. Each day is broken up into a few exercises with a final assignment to finish each mini-project.

## Goals

My overall goal is to do one of these assigments every day. Even if I cant finish the project in one day, consistancy will be the main focus. In the beginning, my goal is to at least commit every day in this repo.

## notes

I made some modifcations to my directories and there were a few messy commits. I've also slacked on making daily commits and piling a bunch of saves with no commits.

### Modifications

Each day is split up into a directory. Example ~/repos/100days-Python/day1 or ~/repos/100days-Python/day2 and so on. In each directory, there will be multiple .py files but the final assignment for the day will always be listed as "main.py"
