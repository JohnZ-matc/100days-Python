# 100 Days of Python

***

## Project Overview

the point of this project is to practice my Python skills everyday for 100 days. Each day is broken up into a few exercises with a final assignment to finish each mini-project.

***

## Goals

My overall goal is to do one of these assigments every day. Even if I cant finish the project in one day, consistancy will be the main focus. In the beginning, my goal is to at least commit every day in this repo.
