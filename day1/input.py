# The input() function allows users to input information
# When you just put the fucntion by itself and run the program, it will allow you to type and the program stops when you press enter.

# Example
# input()

# Here is a more practical use of the function using the print() function.
# Example
# print("What is your name? ")
# x = input()
# print("Hello, " + x)

# Here is an example of you could take the earlier program and simplify the code into less words.
print("What is your name?")
print("Hello, " + input())
